            <h1 align="center">TRASH MANAGEMENT</h1>
            <h3 align="center">
               As we know that trash management is the most essential part in our day-to-day
               life. For personal hygiene also it plays a very important role and sanitation itself.
               In Japan government is trying to do its best for the proper management of trash.
               For international students while coming to Japan, its quite confusing. In
               Japan, each municipality has their own rules for the separation of the garbage.
               We have to keep them in separate plastic. We have to keep them in garbage
               collecting place near home so every twice a week or once according to
               municipality schedule they will collect the garbage. Simply garbage in divided in
               four major categories. They are as follows: -
            </h3>
            <h3>
               <ul class="circle">
                  <li>Burnable Garbage |  &nbsp;&nbsp;<small>kitchen waste outcome, paper scrabs, small cloth etc.</small></li>
                  <li>Non- Burnable Garbage |  &nbsp;&nbsp;<small>metal product, glass, pottery etc.</small></li>
                  <li>Recyclable Garbage |  &nbsp;&nbsp;<small>newspaper, container jar, can, plastic bottles etc.</small></li>
                  <li>Oversized Garbage |  &nbsp;&nbsp;<small>: large furniture, fridge, washing machine etc.</small></li>

         A supermarket is a large retailing business unit selling a wide variety of consumer
         goods are based on low price appeal, wide variety and variety, self-service and
         heavy emphasis on merchandising appeal. The goods traded are generally food
         products and other low priced, branded and widely used consumer products such
         as groceries, utensils clothes, electronic appliances, household goods, and
         medicines.
         Supermarkets are generally situated in the main shopping centers. Goods are kept
         on racks with clearly labelled price and quality tags in such stores. The customers
         move into the store to pick up goods of their requirements, bring them to the
         cash counter, make payments and home the delivery. However, as compared to
         departmental stores, these markets offer certain services such as free home

                     <h3>AEON</h3>
                     <p>Aeon is a large shopping mall that is located all over Kyoto. It has
                        numerous International and domestic retail stores. In my research I found Aeon
                        to be the 3rd Cheap/affordable market in Kyoto. When talking about the cheap
                        stores in Aeon we can find DAISO (100 yen) shop. Many grocessary items and fast
                        food like Sashimi are at discounted prices here. It is an inexpensive way to enjoy
                        the best food that Japan offers.

                     <h3>GYOMU SUPA</h3>
                     <p>It is the best known cheap store that I have found from my
                        research in Japan and Kyoto too. Daily useable items and groceries are the
                        cheapest here. One of the first things I have noticed when I walk in is just how
                        wide of variety of products that Gyomu offers. Even at the smaller stores, we can
                        be able to find our kitchen items and almost anything we need including frozen
                        foods, spices, sauces and drinks too.

                     <p>As we have only one shop OK in Kyoto but we can find many place in japan
                        we can have the best deal and great discounted items here.
